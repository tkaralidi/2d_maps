# 2d_maps

This is the 'heart' of Aeolus, a MCMC mapping code that maps atmospheres of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. 
Aeolus fits observed light curves assuming that clouds in the observed atmospheres are 'spots' and/or bands.
Aeolus was written in Fortran, but I decided to translate it's mapping 'heart' to Python and make it publicly 
available for anyone to use. 


Here you will soon be able to find the two mapping routines of Aeolus: maps_0.py produces the 
light curve of an atmosphere with spots *only*, and maps_1.py includes spots and jets.
